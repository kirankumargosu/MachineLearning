# Lesson 4: Understand Data with Descriptive Statistics
# Once you have loaded your data into Python you need to be able to understand it.
# The better you can understand your data, the better and more accurate the models that you can build.
# The first step to understanding your data is to use descriptive statistics.
# Today your lesson is to learn how to use descriptive statistics to understand your data.
# I recommend using the helper functions provided on the Pandas DataFrame.
# Understand your data using the head() function to look at the first few rows. Ùè∞Ä
# Review the dimensions of your data with the shape property.
# Look at the data types for each attribute with the dtypes property.
# Review the distribution of your data with the describe() function.
# Calculate pairwise correlation between your variables using the corr() function.
# The below example loads the Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset and summarizes the distribution of each attribute.
