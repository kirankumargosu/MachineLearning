# Lesson 11: Improve Accuracy with Algorithm Tuning
# Once you have found one or two algorithms that perform well on your dataset, you may want to improve the performance
# of those models. One way to increase the performance of an algorithm is to tune it’s parameters to your specific
# dataset. The scikit-learn library provides two ways to search for combinations of parameters for a machine learning
# algorithm:
# Tune the parameters of an algorithm using a grid search that you specify. 􏰀 Tune the parameters of an algorithm using
# a random search.
# Your goal in todays lesson is to practice each search method. The snippet below uses is an example of using a grid
# search for the Ridge Regression algorithm on the Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset.
